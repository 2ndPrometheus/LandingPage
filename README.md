# Serendip - VR Learning Environment for Sustainable Development

This project is a web-based platform developed for the Global Campus initiative by the University of Helsinki. The platform showcases a gamified virtual learning environment aimed at studying sustainable development. The website consists of two main pages: the index page, which introduces the game, and the game-page, where the actual game is streamed from an AWS cloud server.

## Technologies Used

The website is built using the following technologies:

- HTML5: Markup language for creating the structure of web pages.
- CSS3: Styling language for describing the look and formatting of a document written in HTML.
- JavaScript: Programming language for making the web page interactive.
- Bootstrap 4: Popular HTML, CSS, and JS library for developing responsive, mobile-first projects on the web.
- jQuery: Fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library.

## Installation

No specific installation is required to run the website. However, to view the website in a local environment, you would need a modern web browser that supports the latest web standards. Examples include Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, and Microsoft Edge.

## Hosting

The website is hosted on an Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 bucket.

## Developer

The website was developed by Jussi Wright.

## Usage

The index page of the website provides an introduction to the game, explaining its purpose and learning goals. The game-page streams the actual game, which is hosted on an AWS cloud server. The game is an interactive, gamified sustainability adventure where players need to act, negotiate, and find solutions for a sustainable future.
